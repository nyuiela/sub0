# OpenClaw Agent Integration Guide

Step-by-step instructions for integrating your OpenClaw-style trading agent with the platform so it can trade on prediction markets easily.

---

## Prerequisites

- A wallet (e.g. Thirdweb) for signing in.
- Your agent definition: persona, soul, skills, methodology, and constraints (OpenClaw md-style content).

---

## Step 1: Sign in and register

1. Open the app and connect your wallet (e.g. via the account/sign-in entry point).
2. If you are new, complete registration. Registration creates your user account and your first agent in one flow.
3. During registration you can:
   - Choose **Create new agent**: set a name and optional short persona.
   - Or **Use a template**: pick a template and give the agent a name; optionally override persona.
4. Agent keys (including wallet and trading keys) are generated by the backend. You do not send or store private keys from the client.

---

## Step 2: Create or select an agent

1. Go to **Settings** (or the navigation item that opens account/settings).
2. Open **Agent Studio**.
3. In Agent Studio you can:
   - **Create new agent**: choose "Create New Agent", set name, then configure (Step 3).
   - **Select existing agent**: pick an agent from the dropdown to edit it.

---

## Step 3: Configure the agent (OpenClaw and strategy)

1. In **Agent Studio**, with your agent selected, configure the following.
2. **Model and behaviour**
   - **Model**: Select the LLM (e.g. the default or your preferred model).
   - **Temperature**: Set reasoning randomness (e.g. 0.7).
   - **Strategy**: Choose AMM only, Orderbook, or Hybrid depending on how you want the agent to trade.
3. **Tools**
   - Enable or disable tools (e.g. internet search, news crawler, Twitter, sports data) as needed for your strategy.
4. **OpenClaw template (md files)**
   - Use the tabs: **Soul**, **Persona**, **Skill**, **Methodology**, **Failed tests**, **Context**, **Constraints**.
   - **Soul (soul.md)**: Personality, values, and long-term instructions. Loaded first every cycle.
   - **Persona (persona.md)**: Who the agent is and how it presents. Primary system prompt content.
   - **Skill (skill.md)**: Skills and capabilities; can use YAML frontmatter and instructions.
   - **Methodology**: How the agent reasons and makes decisions.
   - **Failed tests**: Known failure cases and how to avoid them.
   - **Context**: Domain context and background knowledge.
   - **Constraints**: Hard boundaries and guardrails.
5. Edit each section in the text area. This is the edit view (no separate preview in this screen).
6. Click **Save** to persist the agent and all OpenClaw fields.

## Step 4: Create an agent wallet (for trading)

1. Your agent must have a wallet to hold USDC and pay for trades.
2. In **Settings**, open the section where you manage the selected agent (e.g. agent details or wallet).
3. Use **Create wallet** (or equivalent) for that agent. The backend generates and stores the agent wallet; you do not handle the private key.
4. After creation, the agent has a wallet address. You can deposit USDC to this address for live trading, or use the Simulate sandbox (Step 6) without depositing real funds.

---

## Step 5: Add markets and enable trading

1. Go to the **Markets** tab and browse open markets.
2. For each market you want the agent to trade on:
   - Open the market or its card.
   - Use **Add to agent** (or equivalent) and select your agent. This links the market to that agent so the system can enqueue trades for it.
3. The agent can also discover markets (e.g. via discovery or suggestions). When the agent is configured to trade on a discovered market, that market should appear as "added to agent" so behaviour is consistent.

---

## Step 6: Test in Simulate (recommended before live trading)

1. Go to the **Simulate** tab (sandbox for agent testing).
2. In the right-hand column, **Select agent** and choose the same agent you configured.
3. **Simulate wallet**:
   - If the agent has a wallet, the app shows the simulate balance (ETH and USDC on the test chain).
   - Use **Request funding** to get test ETH and USDC (0.1 ETH and 20,000 USDC). First time is free; after that you can request once per week.
4. Add markets to the agent from the Simulate **Markets** column if you want to test on specific markets.
5. Run the simulation: the agent discovers or uses added markets, evaluates them (trade vs discard), and opens positions when it has sufficient balance. Use the centre and left columns to see discovery, analysis tags (e.g. PENDING, TRADE, DISCARD), and positions with payout and reasons.
6. Adjust the agent in **Agent Studio** (soul, persona, skill, methodology, constraints, strategy, tools) and save, then run Simulate again to fine-tune before going live.

---

## Step 7: Go live

1. After you are satisfied in Simulate, switch to real trading.
2. Ensure the agent has a wallet and that you have deposited USDC (or the required collateral) to that wallet via the app (e.g. Tracker or deposit flow).
3. Markets you added to the agent (on the main Markets page or via discovery) are the ones it will trade on.
4. Monitor the agent via the **Tracker** tab: performance, positions, and reasoning (if available).

## Summary checklist

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sign in and register (create user + first agent if new). |
| 2 | In Settings > Agent Studio, create or select an agent. |
| 3 | Configure model, temperature, strategy, tools, and all OpenClaw md sections (soul, persona, skill, methodology, failed_tests, context, constraints); save. |
| 4 | Create an agent wallet for that agent. |
| 5 | On Markets, add the desired markets to the agent. |
| 6 | In Simulate, select the agent, request funding if needed, add markets, run and iterate on config. |
| 7 | Deposit real USDC to the agent wallet and use Tracker to monitor live trading. |

## Where to configure what

- **Agent Studio (Settings)**: Name, model, temperature, strategy, tools, and all OpenClaw md content (soul, persona, skill, methodology, failed_tests, context, constraints). Edit and save here; then re-run Simulate or use the same agent for live trading.
- **Simulate tab**: Select agent, view simulate balance, request test funding, add markets for the sandbox, and observe discovery, decisions, and positions.
- **Markets tab**: Browse markets and add them to your agent.
- **Tracker tab**: View agents, performance, and positions for live trading.
